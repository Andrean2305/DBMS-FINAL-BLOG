     <h3 class ="regularText">Problem</h3> 
     <h4 class ="regularKalimat"> One person needed a car for everyday use, but lacked information about the vehicle's specs, so he bought a 70's BMW that wasn't very suitable for everyday driving. Through the programs/apps we create, we want to give users an idea of ​​which vehicle is the most cost-effective option according to their budget.</h4>

    <div class = "desc">
     <h3 class ="regularText">Solution</h3> 
     <h4 class ="regularKalimat">A website/app with a simple user interface that allows you to mix and match vehicle specifications and algorithms to suit your needs and budget.</h4>

    <div class = "desc">
     <h3 class ="regularText">Idea</h3> 
     <h4 class ="regularKalimat">For the final database project, we plan to create an automotive website that provides recommendations and information about vehicle types. The website shows vehicle type, fuel type, engine type, displacement, luggage and many other vehicle specifications. Flexibly code any solution you need using datasets collected from the web and stored as CSV files. It not only displays vehicle information, but also compares those vehicles to help users better understand which vehicle type is right for them.</h4>
